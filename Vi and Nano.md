**Vi**

vi is an interactive text editor that is display-oriented: 
The screen of your terminal acts as a window into the file you are editing. 
Changes you make to the file are reflected in what you see. 
Using vi you can insert text anywhere in the file very easily. 
Most of the vi commands move the cursor around in the file.

**Nano**

nano is an easy to use command line text editor for Unix and Linux operating systems. 
It includes all the basic functionality youâ€™d expect from a regular text editor, like syntax highlighting, 
multiple buffers, search and replace with regular expression support, spellchecking, and more.
